# Raspberry-Object-Detection

## Introduction
* This repository contains python script for the object detection on Raspberry Pi in real time using OpenCV. 
* It uses a already trained MobileNet Architecture stored as Caffe Model. 
* This model uses Single Shot Detection algorithm for prediction.
* Look for the architecture detail at [here](https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Raspberry-Object-Detection/blob/master/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt)
